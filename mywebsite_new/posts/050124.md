**The Meeting of Collections in Marseille; a Monumental Survey at MoMA; and Mark Rothko’s Lesser-Known Paintings (Which Weren’t Rectangles)**

**Marseille, “From Basquiat to Edith Piaf: Shared Passions” (Until Sept. 23)**This meeting of two collections—the collection gallerist Yvon Lambert donated to the French state, and that of the first museum dedicated to Mediterranean culture—invites a fresh exchange between contemporary and historical pieces. Lambert, who is from Provence, can trace his taste for collecting back to the art of the sunny region. Here, 80 contemporary works from Lambert by the likes of Jean-Michel Basquiat, Cy Twombly, and Nan Goldin are juxtaposed with 150 historical artifacts from the Mucem museum. [_mucem.org_](https://www.mucem.org/programme/exposition-et-temps-forts/passions_partagees)

**New York, “Cato: Love Song” (Opens May 1)**New York welcomes the twentysomething artist Cato to its art scene. In the British painter’s collage-like canvases, oversize heads and hands pasted onto geometric bodies radiate with emotion. These portraits are enigmatic snapshots of life, celebrating Black culture and referencing figures from Cato’s life. In preparation for the show, Cato spent his first month living in New York, drawing on the city’s energy and rich history for inspiration. [_ericfirestonegallery.com_](https://www.ericfirestonegallery.com/exhibitions/cato-love-song)

**New York, “LaToya Ruby Frazier: Monuments of Solidarity” (Opens May 12)**Artist and advocate LaToya Ruby Frazier is, above all, a storyteller. Her photography captures narratives typically left out of the media, such as the effects of closing factories in the Rust Belt and the toxic waterways of Flint, Michigan. In a long-awaited survey at the Museum of Modern Art, Frazier presents selections from her past projects alongside performance art videos, poems, and other materials that highlight the perspectives of Black working-class communities throughout the American Midwest. [_moma.org_](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5574)

**Oslo, “Mark Rothko: Paintings on Paper” (Opens May 16)**While Mark Rothko is known for his modest abstract rectangles and wielding of color theory, his paintings on paper are a well-kept secret. Toward the later half of his career, Rothko produced hundreds of these watercolors and acrylics, from landscapes and portraits to surrealist styles. The National Museum draws attention to these obscure works in Scandinavia’s first major Rothko survey. [_nasjonalmuseet.no_](https://www.nasjonalmuseet.no/en/exhibitions-and-events/national-museum/exhibitions/2024/mark-rothko/)

**Vienna, “Eva Beresin: Thick Air” (Opens May 1)**In artist Eva Beresin’s painting “Absorbed by Digestion,” two distorted figures wearing royal crowns and cartoonishly big shoes stand in the company of a few critters and what looks like the Pink Panther. In a flurry of wild, dreamlike scenes like this, the Hungarian painter blurs the line between uncanny and funny. The mingling of the grotesque and whimsical in her work is frequently rife with satirical and existential themes. [_albertina.at_](https://www.albertina.at/en/exhibitions/eva-beresin/)
