### **Burberry Opens the Doors to Its Redesigned Fifth Avenue Flagship**
### **The brand opts for a more minimalist aesthetic for its latest NYC retail venture**

This past spring, Burberry hosted a popular pop-up shop on Fifth Avenue where tailors were on hand to customize the brand’s iconic trench coat. That same space has now been christened as Burberry’s newest flagship, its first under the creative direction of designer Daniel Lee. The store will go heavy on leather goods, a specialty of Lee’s, and also offer an assortment of ready-to-wear and other accessories. Need to tailor a suit or monogram a bag? This is the place to do it.

The hub’s new minimalist look includes stark concrete floors and bespoke wooden sculptures by L.A.-based artist Casey McCafferty. The overall vibe is more organic than previous design iterations with welcomed pops of color in the form of plush cobalt blue sofas dotted throughout the store.

While the brand’s color palette has evolved—the store’s exterior is now a soothing seafoam shade rather than a tawdry taupe—Burberry’s iconic check motif is still its calling card. Its signature design currently appears as pear-hued inflatable pool rings in the display windows facing Fifth Avenue. It’s a playful twist on Burberry’s proven legacy. The message we’re getting is: it is never too late to reinvent oneself.
