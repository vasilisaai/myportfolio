### Guess How Fast Blackpink’s Jennie Collaboration With Calvin Klein Will Sell Out?
### Blinks, be prepared to set your alarms.

In the last few weeks Blackpink’s Jennie Kim has blessed the world with a Coachella performance turned [TikTok meme](https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=jennie coachella are you ready&t=1683212242023), a delightful Met Gala look, and now she’s done it again, this time with her very own [Calvin Klein capsule collection](https://www.calvinklein.us/en/jennie-collection). Aptly titled Jennie Kim for Calvin Klein, it features the brand’s classic silhouettes infused with her angelic touch.

For sharp-eyed fans, this comes as no surprise — Jennie has been [sneakily teasing the pieces](https://www.tiktok.com/@pinkshvt/video/7227118568477969691?q=jennie calvin klein collection&t=1683213396136) at soundchecks over the last few weeks. The two have history together as she’s been a face for the brand since 2021. But even before that, she considered herself a longtime fan. “Collaborating with Calvin Klein on this capsule has been an exciting progression in our partnership,” says Jennie via the press release. “This collection reflects my everyday style and is based on many essentials that have become staples in my wardrobe.” 

Everyday for Jennie means minimalist bralettes and sweats in a soothing palette of pastels in shades like lilac and chalk blue. The collection also includes a selection of sleek bodysuits, dresses, and skirts that are the perfect blend of comfortable and sexy. To complete the capsule wardrobe there are also denim shirts and nineties-inspired loose jeans that come in matching colors. Plus, embroidered in the t-shirts and crewnecks is a loving touch: the Calvin Klein logo and an adorable doodle heart written in her handwriting. 

To get fans excited (not that they need much prodding) the brand dropped the campaign images and short films today. Shot by Korean photographer Hong Jang Hyuan, Jennie is silhouetted against a mystical waterfall, falling into a pile of mattresses, and laying serenely in a pool of water. It’s a surreal yet soft departure from her usual K-pop persona, which is more splashy and dramatic. 

Prices range from $25 to $150 and hits select stores as well as [online](https://www.calvinklein.us/) on May 10. Whether you’re a [Blink](https://black-pink.fandom.com/wiki/Blink_(fandom)) or not, the collection is guaranteed to be sell out fast so clear your schedule and expect to compete with her army of fans to get your hands on a piece.
