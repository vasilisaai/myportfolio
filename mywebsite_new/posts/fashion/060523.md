### **Moschino Revisits the 80s With Their Newest Line**
### **MO5CH1NO JEANS celebrates denim using the brand’s signature tongue-in-cheek humor.**

Lately denim trends seem to be firmly stuck in the early aughts, with the return of low rise silhouettes and roomier styles. Moschino, the brand best known for their playful designs like heart shaped bags, is bucking the trend in favor of a different decade: the 80s. For their latest line, [MO5CH1NO JEANS](https://www.moschino.com/us_en/moschino-jeans/women/clothing.html?size=12&start=48&page=5), the brand mined their archives and revived their 1986 Moschino Jeans Line by founder Franco Moschino. 

True to the brand’s sensibilities, the vibe is edgy with tongue-in-cheek playfulness, as seen in the line’s oversized button earrings and denim purses. From stonewashing to patchwork to riffs on snakeskin, the collection plays with the idea of what we traditionally think of as denim. You’ll also find utilitarian styles in the form of jumpsuits, high waisted jeans, and overalls but there are plenty of sexy pieces, including an array of corsets and bustier tops as well as printed and trompe l’oeil styles. And while the name nods to jeans, that’s not the only stuff available, as you’ll find a healthy dose of Barbiecore pink in the form of oversized blazers, ruched dresses, and lightweight knits. To round it all out, the brand nodded to its signature heart motif, which repeats on jackets, tops, and minidresses, all of which are sure to be big hits.

Prices start at $135 for tank tops and top out at just under $900 for leather styles. Shop all of the styles [here](https://www.moschino.com/us_en/moschino-jeans/women/clothing.html?size=12&start=48&page=5).
