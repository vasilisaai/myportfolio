### **An Unexpected Luxury Fashion and Beauty Crossover**
### **Haider Ackermann partnered up with Augustinus Bader to give the bottles a makeover.**

The fashion world isn’t solely limited to what’s in our closet as these days you’ll find it spills into bathroom cabinets and makeup pouches. You only need to look at the likes of Paco Rabanne’s [metallic makeups](https://www.pacorabanne.com/ww/en/fragrance/homepagemakeup) and Prada with their [new skincare line](https://www.prada.com/us/en/womens/beauty/skincare/c/10460US) for proof. The latest in this slew of crossovers? Designer Haider Ackermann partnering up with the award-winning, celebrity-beloved skincare line Augustinus Bader. Can the Colombian and French designer’s newest design walk the runway? No. But it can support cellular regeneration in the skin.

Augustinus Bader, the man, is a university professor and biomedical doctor who uses the same science which heals burn patients to treat acne scars and smooth wrinkles with his namesake line of products. Known for their innovation (with a hefty price tag to match), the brand attracts high profile fans like Gwyneth Paltrow and Courteney Cox. Now, Bader is taking luxury skin care to the next tier, giving his two cult-favorite moisturizers, The Rich Cream and The Cream, a makeover courtesy of Ackerman. The designer, known for his beautiful tailoring like the [haute couture](https://10magazine.com/jean-paul-gaultier-x-haider-ackermann-couture-ss23/) he presented for Jean Paul Gaultier this year, translated his clean, effortless cool aesthetic to the look of the new bottles. Named The Limited Editions, they’re sleek bullet-like bottles that’ll run you $565 for 50mL and a refill. Like the name implies, you’ll only be able to buy them for a brief moment of time so if you’re looking to splurge, act fast.
