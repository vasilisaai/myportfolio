**Window Shop Burberry’s Winter Collection Now**
**Saks Fifth Avenue is the first retail partner to welcome Daniel Lee’s debut.** 

If you’re in New York City, you might notice the windows of [Saks Fifth Avenue](https://www.saksfifthavenue.com/) look a little different this week. In honor of Daniel Lee’s debut Winter 2023 collection for [Burberry](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwiIieae77qBAxUDT0cBHUgtBH8YABAAGgJxdQ&ase=2&gclid=CjwKCAjwsKqoBhBPEiwALrrqiKBIGcqtUkFgxWjhXJvqPb2Hj29hNhDdtFx9It-asWE6zyo68SOlthoCOZAQAvD_BwE&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESaOD2Dhcri7vRjruEY3nNK6lH6QUolqXJjZnWC2x6TXTxTQj3Z8gyjQwLOKty5lJzqRtZPzNfY3ZTEZjI1Hhz6Xa-RYmCm3TdTKoPudgFltYlCn2YeMVwrWjQWlKcrBJVmI0VTu7kgVDl&sig=AOD64_3LhrhxlxwMEfKF0qy6tnuk6NuwzA&q&nis=4&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjmptqe77qBAxXQF1kFHQxbC9cQ0Qx6BAgOEAE), the department store has created a series of window installations featuring floral sculptures mixed in with pieces from the line including womenswear, menswear, shoes, bags, and other accessories. Not bad for a warm welcome.

Saks is the first partner to introduce the collection, so of course they had to go all out. Meant to be an immersive experience, the first thing you’ll notice is the bright yellow shade that fills the space. Called mimosa, it’s their seasonal hue. Also worth noting is the floral motif. As seen repeatedly in Lee’s debut, it’s brought to life inside the store. Rose sculptures dot the space, with shelves for products nestled within, as if your new handbag suddenly bloomed to life. If you want to see this in person, you can check it out through September 26th, or browse the collection [online](https://www.saksfifthavenue.com/brand/burberry) and at select Saks Fifth Avenue [stores](https://www.saksfifthavenue.com/locations).
