**Victoria’s Secret Latest Collection Brings Back the Era of the Supermodel**
**Naomi Campbell, Gisele Bündchen and more are featured in their Icons campaign.**

What makes an icon? To Victoria’s Secret, it’s how she holds herself. Though the brand has experienced a tumultuous past few years filled with criticisms and a pivot from less angels to more inclusivity, it’s making a return with its roots in mind. Today, they  announced their newest collection, The Icon, with the new Icon by Victoria’s Secret Push-Up Demi bra at its center. Featuring veteran VS icons and new faces, the supermodel is back in full force — albeit adapted through a 2023 point of view.

Gisele Bündchen, Naomi Campbell, Adriana Lima, and Candice Swanepoel return for this collection, and it’s so good to see them. They’re accompanied by big names like Adut Akech, Hailey Bieber, Paloma Elsesser, Sui He and Emily Ratajkowski — all multi-hyphenate women in their own rights. A few of these faces will be seen in the [Victoria’s Secret’s World Tour](https://www.victoriassecret.com/us/vs/vsnow/worldtour) this fall, a transformed version of the VS Fashion Show that was last seen in 2018. The new concept is equal parts documentary, part spectacle starring [Doja Cat](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a44693642/doja-cat-headlining-victorias-secret-world-tour-2023/).

For The Icon campaign, photographer Mikael Jansson captures the silhouettes of each woman in the all-star cast. The pared back images are far from the over-the-top spectacle the brand was known for in the past — gone are the big bouncy curls coupled with gigantic angel wings and glitter. In its place are  wearable silhouettes in an array of neutral tones with pops of bright color. “It’s an exciting, elevated collection to add to your wardrobe, while reinforcing that we are all icons,” says Janie Schaffer, the Chief Design Officer at Victoria’s Secret. The idea is less about an unattainable fantasy and more about being grounded in reality. The new Victoria’s Secret is asking what women want and need but will it resonate with customers? From the looks of this campaign, it’s a promising start.
