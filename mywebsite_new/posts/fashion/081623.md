### **Moncler and Billionaire Boys Club Are Teaming Up**
### **The drop features Pusha-T and No Malice.**

Between a [successful debut at Louis Vuitton](https://usa.10magazine.com/rihannas-louis-vuitton-campaign-is-the-ultimate-pregnancy-photo-shoot/) and celebrating the upcoming 20th anniversary of his brand, Billionaire Boys Club, with Nigo, Pharrell Williams is having a very good year. For his fans, it’s about to get even better, as [BBC](https://www.bbcicecream.com/) is teaming up with [Moncler](https://www.moncler.com/en-us/special-projects/moncler-bbc?ds_cid=71700000037233898&gclid=CjwKCAjwxOymBhAFEiwAnodBLK_Y-VI7VAokarg7Q_cBMVBjT9nVNZFSXBrNw_-L8wCVecGibm1tTBoCrV4QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) on [a special collaboration](https://www.bbcicecream.com/). Launching today, the eight-piece capsule collection features a mix of outerwear, tops, and accessories that combine the signature details from both brands. 

Key pieces include a [down puffer](https://www.bbcicecream.com/collections/bbc-x-moncler/products/embossed-diamond-dollars-down-jacket-f23-sep) embossed with BBC’s iconic diamond and dollars print as well as a wool [varsity jacket](https://www.bbcicecream.com/collections/bbc-x-moncler/products/hooded-varsity-jacket-f23-sep) with a detachable down hood. Other standouts include a crisp yellow [knit sweater](https://www.bbcicecream.com/collections/bbc-x-moncler/products/girocollo-tricot-knit-sweater-f23-sep) and [classic hoodie](https://www.bbcicecream.com/collections/bbc-x-moncler/products/classic-logos-hoodie-f23-sep), both featuring the revamped logo that combines BBC’s recognizable astronaut with Moncler’s lettering. For those looking for accessories, there’s a wool and cashmere [printed beanie](https://www.bbcicecream.com/collections/bbc-x-moncler/products/berretto-tricot-diamonds-dollars-beanie-f23-sep) as well as BBC’s version of Moncler’s [Trailgrip Après boots](https://www.bbcicecream.com/collections/bbc-x-moncler/products/apres-trail-x-bbc-snow-boot-f23-sep), made with Vibram tread and a GORE-TEX waterproof membrane, and covered in a colorful camouflage print. With prices starting at $290 and going up to $3,380, the collaboration skews more luxury, but that’s likely not going to stop fans from buying everything up.

The accompanying campaign includes two longtime Williams collaborators, featuring the likes of the Clipse, the hip hop duo consisting of Pusha-T and No Malice. Clad in the collection, they lounge on a frost covered set that includes oversized Diamonds & Dollars prop. While it might still be summer outside, these images are definitely getting the brands’ collective fans hyped for winter.
