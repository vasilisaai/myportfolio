### A Summer Drop For The Downtown Set
### **Acne Studio’s latest collection is made for the sun and the city.**

It’s a summer of contrasts, at least according to Acne Studios. The brand dropped the first pieces of their [High Summer capsule](https://www.acnestudios.com/us/en/woman/high-summer-capsule/?cgid=woman-high-summer&start=0&sz=24) yesterday, featuring an eye-catching mix of ruffles, bows, and florals as well as metallics and neons. The boxy and futuristic silhouettes come from their February runway in Paris, infused with the soft beauty of nature’s flora and fauna. You could describe the tone as something close to a space alien on summer vacation.

With a futuristic element, these pieces are destined to be a big hit this summer. Acne does a great job juxtaposing the new with old and cute with cool in the form of watercolor prints as well as floral accents on fluid skirts, puddle trousers, and silk minidresses. The palette, consisting of bold green and magenta earth tones as well as cooler white and blue tones, takes warm weather dressing and gives it a bit of edge, a perfect antidote to all of the airy yet boring white linen pieces that dominate the season. 

To complement these pieces, there are plenty of interesting accessories as well. The most quirky? Oversized alien-esque shades, back this season in new colors. You can now disguise your hangover in glossy black, pink, and white frames. And, for a fuzzy new best friend, the capsule includes the iconic Logo Tote in terry cloth acid green and the geometric Distortion bag in a subdued lilac. Sounds like everyone in Dimes Square has their summer wardrobe sorted.

The collection is out in stores and online [here](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjHnrep-8L_AhXeS3IKHdL4AS4YABAAGgJxdQ&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESbeD2CXjF-USQZhDHiQ5h2jfE9GoO6DrvdYS9JVxJZxP9lHPWZQPa8g74QseS86TFbOWdXbFb8ioceiE49pcdq6SgWxBkiD6fsJOzy21dZlR_PpJe8wtBw-pzMoITzXy0ca2iinfhVpAq8hnEVRI&sig=AOD64_2w6TUDWfR7M-l8CM8Lr8rGjhxOnQ&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjC3q2p-8L_AhWLGVkFHUD8A4UQ0Qx6BAgEEAM) now.
