**Buddhist Wisdom, Italian Simplicity**

This is not your average renovation: the Ramagrama Stupa, located in western Nepal, is the world’s only original and undisturbed stupa, a Buddhist shrine with relics buried underneath a mound of earth. Italian architect Stefano Boeri has been entrusted with creating a [masterplan](https://www.stefanoboeriarchitetti.net/en/project/ramagrama-stupa-lumbini/) for revitalizing the sacred site (currently on the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List), which dates back to the 6th century B.C. The expansion and enhancement of its facilities will preserve the stupa itself, centered around a centuries-old Bodhi Tree. Boeri, who is known for his sustainable architecture that includes his lauded Vertical Forest—a residential skyscraper in Milan which hosts hundreds of trees on its facades, completed in 2014—has incorporated lush flora into much of the mandala-shaped design. A “Peace Meadow” will encircle the ancient stupa without disturbing it, encircled by a biodiversity garden with 80,000 native plants from 70 different species. On the outer perimeter are four domelike facilities for meditation and prayer for the thousands of monks, pilgrims, and tourists that the stupa attracts. The heavenly plan will trigger a feasibility study to attract funding from UNESCO and the government of Nepal. [_moksha.foundation_](https://www.moksha.foundation/ramagrama-masterplan)
