**Was Geht, Berlin?**
In Berlin, the past and present coexist. The site of the former Kunsthaus Tacheles, an artist colony located in the happening Mitte district, is now inhabited by a new [Fotografiska](https://www.fotografiska.com/berlin/) museum. “We want to look ahead to the future while embracing the past. And to do so in a casual way. That is very Berlin,” says the museum’s designer Werner Aisslinger. With late hours (open until 11pm daily) and a rooftop bar, the museum hopes to be a hub of culture, and probably plenty of first dates. For a second dose of photography, [C/O Berlin](http://www.co-berlin.org/en/program/exhibitions/mary-ellen-mark) presents the first major retrospective of the U.S. photojournalist Mary Ellen Mark. Titled “Encounters,” (until Jan. 18) it showcases her humanistic touch as she photographed the ordinary lives, hopes, and difficulties of the “unfamous”—as she describes those on societies’ margins—against the backdrop of larger social themes. Last but not least, these playfully chic studio apartments by the aparthotel brand, [Locke](https://www.lockeliving.com/en/berlin/locke-at-east-side-gallery), have opened on Berlin’s River Spree, with the audiophile bar and restaurant, Anima, downstairs. A socially enriching hi-fi audio and gastronomy experience? How Berlin.
